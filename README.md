## DESCRIPTION  
For the Developer Test, I chose prolem #5:
```````````````
Create an interesting display of public services available by zip code,  
city, and/or street address using http://seeclickfix.com/open311/v2/docs.  
Assume that most users would not know their townâ€™s latitude and longitude;  
so, some additional look-ups would be required.
```````````````
To achieve this solution, I began by creating a simple HTML document with a few elements (jumbotron, rows, columns). Then, I utlized the OpenWeatherMap API to grab the lat/lon of a zip code (and also provide the user with current weather conditions of that zipcode), and then sent the lat/lon through the SeeClickFix API to grab information about public services offered within the search parameter.
